# Code of Conduct
We are committed to providing a friendly, inclusive, and respectful experience for all contributors.
This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participation in the MCQP community,
as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the following code.

## Our Pledge
We, as members, contributors, and maintainers of this project, pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
sexual identity.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.


## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
* **Being respectful**: Respectful communication and collaboration. Listen to others' perspectives.
* **Being kind and considerate**: Be considerate of your peers’ time, and be kind in your interactions with them.
* **Being inclusive**: Encourage diversity of thought and include others in conversations. Create a space where everyone feels welcome.
* **Being professional**: When in doubt, act professionally, and assume others are doing the same. Give feedback that is constructive and fair.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
* **Harassment**: Offensive comments or jokes based on gender, race, ethnicity, religion, or any other aspect of identity.
* **Personal attacks**: Personal insults, name-calling, or dismissive behavior.
* **Discriminatory comments**: Comments that exclude, belittle, or disparage individuals or groups.
* **Trolling**: Engaging in disruptive or provocative behavior to provoke negative reactions.
* **Spamming**: Repetitive posts, unsolicited messages, or irrelevant content that disrupts conversations.

## Our Responsibilities
Maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior, and they will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

* **Enforcement**: If a member of the community engages in unacceptable behavior, project maintainers will first attempt to resolve the situation privately. If necessary, they may escalate the matter to a public warning or temporary ban.
* **Escalation**: If the unacceptable behavior continues or is severe, the maintainers may ban the user from the project or community permanently, or take other necessary actions as deemed appropriate.

## Reporting Issues
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or if you have any concerns about how to handle a situation, we encourage you to report the behavior directly to the maintainers. You can do this by:
* **Private message**: Reach out to the maintainers directly via email or private GitHub message.
* **Issues**: Use the GitHub issue tracker to report any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct. Be sure to provide enough context so that the issue can be investigated thoroughly.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the project’s GitHub repository, issues, discussions, and any other places where contributors are involved in the project. It also applies to any related activities, events, or communications hosted by the project or its maintainers.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team, who will review and investigate the matter. All reports will be handled in a confidential and respectful manner. After the investigation, the project team will take the necessary actions, which may include:
* A private or public warning to the participant.
* Temporary or permanent bans from the project or community spaces.
* Any other actions deemed necessary to ensure a respectful environment.
